    title: 'Attitude of Learning',
    message: [
      'IT is developing globally every minute and second, and new paradigms are emerging and existing tools are constantly being updated.',
      'In order to adapt to the rapidly changing IT field, it is important to have a cooperative and learning attitude. ' +
        'It is important to be able to approach and use any IT technology. But more importantly, ' +
        'if we focus on productivity, the time given to us is limited, so even if some skilled developers can show productivity ' +
        'of more than 2 people, it is difficult to catch up with the collaboration of 2~3 developers.',
      'Therefore, the most important thing for a startup developer is team collaboration through the attitude of learning. ' +
        'We should always be humble, respect each others, collaborate, and find something to learn in everything.',
      'On the other hand, I thought that as a complete software engineer, I should have the ability to develop, launch and maintain IT service for myself. ' +
        'So I have experienced all web/app/server/data related fields, and learned any IT skills with interest.',
      'Every time, I encountered the conflict of concepts and limitations in order to learn IT skills on different paradigms, ' +
        'and overcome those limitations. So I am familiar with the limit situation. ' +
        "I'm ready to learn new skills, with humble and not being conceited because I know my insufficiency in the infinite development and change of IT. " +
        'Also, I can participate in any IT field based on my wide range of practical knowledge.',

    title:
      'The Problem Solving Ability comes from a Clear Sense of Purpose and Perseverance',
    message: [
      "I'm a person with excellent problem-solving skills and perseverance. One of the most important factors in work " +
        'is consequently that did we solve the problem or not?',
      "When given a task, I've devoted myself to the task until it was completed, forgetting everything else. " +
        'As I majored in statistics, I approach the problem based on a high mathematical understanding, perseverance, and meticulousness.',
      'When given a difficult task, we will face difficulties and psychological burdens, but I can never give in and ' +
        'continue to challenge. Even if I spend less time playing and sleeping, I can take responsibility for the given task ' +
        'and complete them to the end. Because such difficulties are what make me grow.',
      'While working for an early-stage startup, I continued to work in extreme situations of waking up at 10:30 a.m., ' +
        'and leaving work at 3-4 a.m. for about a year and a half. This means that the average daily working hours ' +
        'are more than 12 hours, excluding break time. Every day, I had to solve problems that I had never experienced before. ' +
        'It was a very difficult time physically and mentally, but I completed the task with a clear sense of purpose and perseverance.',
      'And this experience proved that I can solve any problem if I try hard.',

    title: 'My superpower = Meticulousness',
    message: [
      "I'm very meticulous enough to find that only one bold font is incorrectly applied to a bullet point in hundreds of pages of document. " +
        'When I look at a document, I often find typos that others cannot find. Because of this, I have been in charge of document work often.',
      'Even when developing, I write code very carefully. Sloppily written code may seem to solve the problem, ' +
        'but later, it may cause more maintenance costs. Therefore, I write code with a well-organized structure ' +
        'considering team collaboration, reusability, and scalability.',

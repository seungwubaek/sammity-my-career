      'The Problem Solving Ability comes from a Clear Sense of Purpose and Perseverance',
    message: [
      "I'm a person with excellent problem-solving skills and perseverance. One of the most important factors in work " +
        'is consequently that did we solve the problem or not?',
      "When given a task, I've devoted myself to the task until it was completed, forgetting everything else. " +
        'As I majored in statistics, I approach the problem based on a high mathematical understanding, perseverance, and meticulousness.',
      'When given a difficult task, we will face difficulties and psychological burdens, but I can never give in and ' +
        'continue to challenge. Even if I spend less time playing and sleeping, I can take responsibility for the given task ' +
        'and complete them to the end. Because such difficulties are what make me grow.',

        'and leaving work at 3-4 a.m. for about a year and a half. This means that the average daily working hours ' +
        'are more than 12 hours, excluding break time. Every day, I had to solve problems that I had never experienced before. ' +
        'It was a very difficult time physically and mentally, but I completed the task with a clear sense of purpose and perseverance.',

        'When I look at a document, I often find typos that others cannot find. Because of this, I have been in charge of document work often.',
      'Even when developing, I write code very carefully. Sloppily written code may seem to solve the problem, ' +
        'but later, it may cause more maintenance costs. Therefore, I write code with a well-organized structure ' +
        'considering team collaboration, reusability, and scalability.',

      'The Problem Solving Ability comes from a Clear Sense of Purpose and Perseverance',
    message: [
      "I'm a person with excellent problem-solving skills and perseverance. One of the most important factors in work " +

        'When I look at a document, I often find typos that others cannot find. Because of this, I have been in charge of document work often.',
      'Even when developing, I write code very carefully. Sloppily written code may seem to solve the problem, ' +

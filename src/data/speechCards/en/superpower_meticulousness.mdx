## My superpower = Meticulousness

I'm very meticulous enough to find that only one bold font is incorrectly applied to a bullet point in hundreds of pages of document.
When I look at a document, I often find typos that others cannot find.
Because of this, I have been in charge of document work often.

Even when developing, I write code very carefully. Sloppily written code may seem to solve the problem,
but later, it may cause more maintenance costs.
Therefore, I write code with a well-organized structure considering team collaboration, reusability, and scalability.

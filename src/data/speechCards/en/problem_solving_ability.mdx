## The Problem Solving Ability comes from a Clear Sense of Purpose and Perseverance

I'm a person with excellent problem-solving skills and perseverance.
One of the most important factors in work is consequently that did we solve the problem or not?

When given a task, I've devoted myself to the task until it was completed, forgetting everything else.
As I majored in statistics, I approach the problem based on a high mathematical understanding, perseverance, and meticulousness.

When given a difficult task, we will face difficulties and psychological burdens, but I can never give in and
continue to challenge. Even if I spend less time playing and sleeping, I can take responsibility for the given task
and complete them to the end. Because such difficulties are what make me grow.

While working for an early-stage startup, I continued to work in extreme situations of waking up at 10:30 a.m.,
and leaving work at 3-4 a.m. for about a year and a half. This means that the average daily working hours
are more than 12 hours, excluding break time. Every day, I had to solve problems that I had never experienced before.
It was a very difficult time physically and mentally, but I completed the task with a clear sense of purpose and perseverance.

And this experience proved that I can solve any problem if I try hard.

## Attitude of Learning

IT is developing globally every minute and second, and new paradigms are emerging and existing tools are constantly being updated.

In order to adapt to the rapidly changing IT field, it is important to have a cooperative and learning attitude.
It is important to be able to approach and use any IT technology. But more importantly,
if we focus on productivity, the time given to us is limited,
so even if some skilled developers can show productivity of more than 2 people,
it is difficult to catch up with the collaboration of 2~3 developers.

Therefore, the most important thing for a startup developer is team collaboration through the attitude of learning.
We should always be humble, respect each others, collaborate, and find something to learn in everything.

On the other hand, I thought that as a complete software engineer,
I should have the ability to develop, launch and maintain IT service for myself.
So I have experienced all web/app/server/data related fields, and learned any IT skills with interest.

Every time, I encountered the conflict of concepts and limitations in order to learn IT skills on different paradigms,
and overcome those limitations. So I am familiar with the limit situation and never give up.

In the infinite development and change of IT World, because I know my insufficiency, I'll be humble, not conceited, and
I'm ready to learn new skills.
Also, I can participate in any IT field based on my wide range of practical knowledge.
